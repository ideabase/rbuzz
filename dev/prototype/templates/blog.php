            <p>Get the most out of your research by using this approach:</p>

            <h4>Determine Your Research Questions Upfront</h4>
            <p>What questions are you trying to answer with your research? It might seem obvious, but many people forget to define their research questions before diving into the research process. It’s important to know what questions you’re trying to answer so that as you begin the research process, you can determine how successfully you’re addressing these items.</p>

            <h4>Create a Research Plan</h4>
            <p>Plan out your research. Start by creating a schedule that specifies when, where and how you will be conducting your research. For example, specify that you will go to the public library every Tuesday and Thursday from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. You can also note what tools you will use to complete your research such as library computers, books, newspapers or other available resources. Having a research plan in place will help you stay organized.

            <h4>Re-evaluate</h4>
            <p>Over the course of your research, pause to re-evaluate your findings. Is what you’re finding in line with what you expected? Are there any things that you’re discovering that you didn’t expect? Make note of these items and adjust your research plan accordingly.</p>
